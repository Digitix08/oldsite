<p class="auto-style1">WARNING</p>
<p class="auto-style2">From commit #284 onwards (and DEFINITELY from commit #287 onwards) 
the &quot;htmlpreview.github.io/user15263/repository/[...]&quot; or 
&quot;htmlpreview.github.io/digitix08/repository/[...]&quot; link no longer works 
(redirects to &quot;user15263.github.io/repository/[...]&quot; and from commit #888 
onwards to &quot;digitix08.github.io/repository/[...]&quot;)</p>
<p>*<a name="*mobile_ver_redirect"></a> the script to redirect to the mobile 
version of the site currently uses <em>the absolute URL</em> (http://stuff.com/file.html) instead of a <em>relative URL</em> 
(file.html), which means that between commits 500 and 800 (including 800) the 
page goes to the &quot;user15263.github.io&quot; (old) URL, which no longer exists</p>
